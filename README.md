> A personal site for essays, fleeting thoughts, learning in public, and fiction.

This site relies heavily on the [unified ecosystem](https://unifiedjs.com/) for turning static markdown into static HTML. The syntax of my mildly modified Markdown is based on [Tobias Davis's](https://davistobias.com/) [blockdown](https://github.com/saibotsivad/blockdown) and some of the fancy bits by [Gwern Branwen's](https://www.gwern.net/Links) [site](https://www.gwern.net/Design#tools). The resulting pages are inspired heavily by [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Design) (again), [Andy Matuschak's notes site](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), and [Maggie Appleton's site](https://maggieappleton.com).

It's worth acknowledging that Maggie's essay on digital gardening was the true gateway drug into the world of digital gardening and learning in public for me.
