1. Accessible: documentation should be readable by everyone within the intended scope and audience.[^1] When the documentation is more technically oriented or requires some pre-requisite knowledge, [notes and essays should clearly list pre-requisite knowledge](/meta/pre-requisites). This allows every role, regardless of level, to feel included.
2. Empathetic
3. Well-Tended
4. Iterative
5. Collaborative
6. Honest: notes and essays should demonstrate both academic and epistemic honesty. The best possible chance must be made to avoid the Dunning-Krueger effect.

[^1]: Audience is ill-defined at this time.
