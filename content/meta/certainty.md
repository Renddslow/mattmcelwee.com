In [Gwern Branwen’s website](https://www.gwern.net/) they use an element of metadata called [“certainty tags”](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags) to indicate how well-supported an idea is. This allows them to [externalize](/essays-manifesto) a concept and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).

We want to adopt this same concept, along with their available tags. This should allow us to indicate a growing certainty as a piece of documentation is tended, but also allows us to get new, uncertain ideas out into the world so we can start to explore and tend them.

## Certainty Tags

1. “certain”
2. “highly likely”
3. “likely”
4. “possible”
5. “unlikely”
6. “highly unlikely”
7. “remote”
