> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. (Matthew 5:5–6)

O Lord, open our lips
<br /> And our mouth shall proclaim your praise.

O God, make speed to save us.
<br /> O Lord, make haste to help us.

Glory to the Father,
<br /> and to the Son,
<br /> and to the Holy Spirit.

As it was in the beginning,
<br /> is now, and ever shall be
<br /> world without end. **Amen.**

**A Prayer for Serenity**

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
<br /> the courage to change the things I can,
<br /> and the wisdom to know the difference.

## Matthew 20:20–34

Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.

“What is it you want?” he asked.

She said, “Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.”

“You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said to them. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?”

“We can,” they answered.

Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”

When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.

“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.”

Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.

## Philippians 2:1–16

If, then, there is any comfort in Christ, any consolation from love, any partnership in the Spirit, any tender affection and sympathy, make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or empty conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,

who, though he existed in the form of God,
<br /> did not regard equality with God
<br /> as something to be grasped,
<br /> but emptied himself,
<br /> taking the form of a slave,
<br /> assuming human likeness.
<br /> And being found in appearance as a human,
<br /> he humbled himself
<br /> and became obedient to the point of death—
<br /> even death on a cross.

Therefore God exalted him even more highly
<br /> and gave him the name
<br /> that is above every other name,
<br /> so that at the name given to Jesus
<br /> every knee should bend,
<br /> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
<br /> and every tongue should confess
<br /> that Jesus Christ is Lord,
<br /> to the glory of God the Father.

Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence but much more now in my absence, work on your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.

Do all things without murmuring and arguing, so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine like stars in the world, holding forth the word of life so that I can boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.

**A Prayer for Serenity**

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
<br /> the courage to change the things I can,
<br /> and the wisdom to know the difference.

Lord Jesus Christ, you did not regard equality with God something to be grasped, but you humbled yourself for our sakes. May I follow you in that same humility, seeking the good of other as far as it may lead to shalom and concord. May I serve you with a humble heart, and may I be willing to be overlooked for the sake of others. To you be all honor, power, and glory, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, who live and reign with you forever and ever. **Amen.**
