Here I argue that the canonical order of the Hebrew Scriptures is best considered as the original [Tanakh](!W) ordering contra the more modern Protestant ordering. While the intertextual nature of the Scriptures allows meaning to be drawn from any[^1] ordering, the Tanakh ordering is best for a a first-time reader.

[^1]: I would suggest that all readings should begin with Genesis 1 through Exodus 20 at the bare minimum with no interleaving or breaks.
