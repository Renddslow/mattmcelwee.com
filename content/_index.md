Hi! I'm [Matt McElwee](/about) and this is my website.

This site is inspired heavily by [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Design), [Andy Matuschak's notes site](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), and [Maggie Appleton's site](https://maggieappleton.com). It attempts to live by the ethos of [digital gardening](/notes-manifesto) and [learning in public](/ideas/learning-public). Overtime I hope it to become a garden of networked thought which helps to capture knowledge and become something of a [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb) (or at least the [public expression](/tools/roam) of it).

The bulk of this site is [notes](/notes) that hope to grow up to become essays one day. If you are interested in how I've [built this site and how to use it](/site), you can. On the other hand, if you want to read [an annotated bibliography](/reading) of all the books I've read and hope to read, you can do that too.
