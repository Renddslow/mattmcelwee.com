ðŸ“– I really believe that one of the most important habits anyone can pick up is voracious reading. Below is a list of books that have really informed my more academic endeavors and interests. All of these books represent reading specifically inline with Christian life and ethic, some politics, theology, or Biblical studies. There are also a select number of fiction books because literature is good and [junk food is helpful](/ideas/junk-food).

**Note**: The inclusion of any work on this list is by no means an endorsement nor tacit agreement with the subject-matter, theses, or conclusions of the same works. Just as any bibliography, this list serves as a place to track the works I have been in conversation with.
