## Evangelicalism Defined

Evangelicalism is classically defined by what has been called [the Bebbington quadrilateral](!W). These are discreet set of four characteristics first defined by David Bebbington in his book _Evangelicalism in Modern Britain_[^britain]:

1. Conversionism - As Bebbington describes it, this is focused chiefly on the conversion of the individual. This is two-fold. On one hand, a person would define themselves as an Evangelical on the basis of their so-called conversion experience. On the other hand, a church or minister might be defined as being Evangelical by being focused on converting souls – especially through the sermon. 
2. Activism - Largely this is focused on the activity of the church. It is not merely settled in prayer and preaching, but works out its spirituality through Evangelism, missions work, and other social-good activities. 
3. Biblicism - This is not only a high view of the Christian Scriptures which often are defined on the basis of their "inspiriation" and "inerrancy,"[^inerrancy] but a sense that the Christian Scriptures are the sole source of inspiration and spiritual knowledge.
4. Crucicentrism - This final characteristic centers the message of the Gospel on the atoning work of Christ on the cross.

These set of distinctions have proven to be quite useful. Many who see themselves in the lineage of Wesley and Edwards – even perhaps Graham – but feel displaced by political attachments associated with Evangelicalism in the popular imagination have clung to them.

The [National Association of Evangelicals](https://www.nae.org/) for instance has fully affirmed Bebbington's definition of Evangelicalism.[^nae] They have then added further clarification for the purposes of research, suggesting that individuals who define themselves as Evangelical (for the sake of research and demography) must affirm the following statements:

1. The Bible is the highest authority for what I believe. 
2. It is very important for me personally to encourage non-Christians to trust Jesus Christ as their Savior. 
3. Jesus Christ’s death on the cross is the only sacrifice that could remove the penalty of my sin. 
4. Only those who trust in Jesus Christ alone as their Savior receive God’s free gift of eternal salvation.

Overall, this defines a useful subsection of American Protestantism.[^british]

[^inerrancy]: I have [alluded elsewhere](/bible/context#:~:text=inspired%2C%20truthful%2C%20and%20authoritative) to my preferred definition here being "inspired, truthful, and authoritative." I find this to avoid the problems associated with both the words inerrant and infallible.

[^british]: It's worth acknowledging that at this time my understanding of the modern state of Evangelicalism in Great Britain. This is an important area of study, but is outside the scope of this essay, as this is focused on a subset within American Evangelicalism, and though the phenomenon of what I will define as "megavangelicalism" has been spread about the world, that spreading is something more of a colonization and is distinctly American.
