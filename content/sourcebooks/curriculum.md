The culture war seems to be shifting. When it began, the central focus was on abortion.[^1] It extended out with concerns of feminism, sexual mores, and the life. But when in the last two years, a seismic shift seems to have taken place. Rather than the culture war being defined by a vision of morality, as in Haidt's [moral foundations theory](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777), the culture war seems to have shifted to what we believe to be true about our purpose and praxis as a nation.

This is born out in current debates over school curriculum, with the most acute focus not on pedagogy or praxis, but on what is considered good and bad content. It would be easy to lump in the concerns about the manner and timing for introducing topics surrounding trans and LGBTQ folks or other forms of sexual education into Haidt's moral foundations theory. Naturally those concerns would fit neatly into group-focused cluster, with its emphasis on authority and sanctity.

Yet a confounding factor is the [sudden interest](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/) in a once niche discipline within legal studies called [Critical Race Theory](!W). This sudden moral panic around the proper teaching of US history is not limited to one party or moral foundation â€“ though the approaches differ significantly. [Haidt highlights](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/) that perhaps this difference is best chalked up to the left's prominent placement within teacher's unions and teaching colleges. The left is able to pull certain levers and the right's hackles are raised.

I would consider however that while we have seen strong overcorrection, especially from the very progressive and even leftist elements of the left, they have not departed from a vision of liberalism and pluralism which were founding ideals of our nation.

The purpose of this sourcebook is to point liberal education as a key mechanism in preserving our democracy and the American project. I will offer fleeting commentary on some sources and allow others to speak for themselves. I have also provided sources which address directly some of those issues which are motivating so much conflict in school board meetings today. The aim is to demonstrate the vast amount of content, technicality, and nuance present in these disciplines and to cast aspersions at the notion that anyone is genuinely trying to infuse curriculum with these disciplines.

A final note before presenting the source list. It is my view that the topics of sexuality, gender, LGBTQ+ issues, and the troubled history of race in America are all important and necessary subjects which all Americans ought to grapple with. The posture of a liberal, pluralistic democracy is not that everyone would come out with the same conclusions, but that we would be introduced to the relevant data and share in a discourse as a community. What I hope these sources will demonstrate is just that.

What these sources will not do is provide the nuance that is desperately needing in determining when and how much we should teach children.

For example, there is considerable value in telling children of a certain age a story about World War II which paints Nazism as pure villainy[^2] and America as a united front against it. Sure it took some time for us to get involved, but in the end, America united against tyranny and fascism. Yet it is equally valuable to tell children (likely of an older age) the story of the of the [1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden](!W), an event attended by more than 20,000 Americans. In this telling of the story of America versus fascism, we are forced to think about [Arendt's banality of evil](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Totalitarianism-Hannah-Arendt/dp/0156701537) and wrestle with the reality that it could happen here.

We shouldn't further our conversations on whether both visions of America should be taught to children.[^3] Rather, we should be ardently focused on when and how we should teach those visions. They cannot be taught at the same time, they are in some ways conflicting stories. But at the same time, they aren't. They are stories of a nation that wrestled with its own demons ([and still is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally)) but ultimately overcame them to fight one of the greatest evils in the last century.

What we do when we try to jettison content out of mere discomfort or a vision of history that can only see the former America and not the latter, we open ourselves up to not learn from past mistakes, not out of hatred for our nation, but out of deep love for both it and our neighbor.
