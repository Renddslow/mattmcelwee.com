The role of money and the Church is relatively uncomplicated. Since the earliest days of the Church, the community cared for the needs of their minister (likely first an elder (a role which evolved into the bishop) and then within a generation the priest) and for the needs of the poor and needy, first within their community and then without.

The Church was born out of the generosity of the Father in his giving his only Son. It is unsurprising that this vision of generosity flowed into the operation of the Church as early as 10 days following the ascension of Jesus (cf Acts 2:42-47).

What _is_ complicated is the role of tithing in the Church. This sourcebook will therefore be divided into two sections. The first will address the question of tithing both in its biblical and its historical context. The second will address the biblical vision of generosity in general. The witness of Scripture is sufficient – in my opinion, to cover the latter case on its own and the voices of scholars and Church fathers from the first section ought to aid in offering context to the second. I will however include a BibleProject video.

## Tithing in the Church

### The Tithe

We see tithing (both the concept and the Hebrew word for it) first appear in **Genesis 14**. Abram had just done battle with the kings of Canaan in order to save his nephew Lot. Following his victory, he encounters a priest of God Most High (_El Elyon_) named Melchizedek who blesses him. Following that blessing, Abram opts to give a tenth (_ma'aser_) of the spoils of war to the priest.

Of course what we are more familiar with is the practice of the priestly tithe practiced under the covenant at Sinai, documented in **Numbers 18**. What often goes under-looked is the two additional tithes.

Some quick context setting, the _Torah_ especially (and then a good bit of the _Nevi'im_) was written to a community of [subsistence farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture). While a few other trades may have been at play (see Bezalel in Exodus 31).

1. The Levitical tithe, **Numbers 18** – This tithe was set aside as a portion for the Levites who were not given farm land. We are not told explicitly, but we tend to read into this that the reason was so that the Levites could be the [teachers of YHWH's _torah_](/sourcebooks/curriculum) as well as their priests serve in a full-time cultic capacity. Farming was a full-time job that was very labor-intensive. So YHWH provided for the physical needs of the Levites, but gave them no land. YHWH was their portion. (Note: the tithe was not the only expression of provision for the Levites (see below)).
2. The festival tithe, **Deuteronomy 14** – This tithe was sort of like a Christmas fund. YHWH had instituted three festivals for which the people would pilgrim to Jerusalem: the [Passover](!W), the [Feast of Weeks](!W) (Pentecost), and the Feast of Tabernacles ([Sukkot](!W)). The festival tithe then was designed to provide the materials the people needed to enjoy the festival. Note that this tithe is not an optional savings account. It is a commanded, yearly tithe.
3. The poor tithe, **Deuteronomy 14** – Every third year, the people of Israel were instructed to take a tithe of their increase (just like the Levitical and festival tithe) and offer it to the Levite, the poor, the immigrants, the orphans, and the widows may "come and eat and be satisfied." There is some debate on how much this tithe actually constituted. It is unclear from the wording if it was designed to be a tithe yearly, constituting three years worth of tithe; or if it was a tithe of three years worth (so that each year you would set aside 3.33%); or if every third year, 10% from a single year was required.

All together, there are three possible guesses for the the total amount of tithe an Israelite family would've been commanded to give yearly:

1. 23.3% - Taking the Levitical and festival together and then assuming that the poor tithe is 10% across the three years.
2. 20% for two years and 30% on the third year. This takes the Levitical and festival together on years 1 and 2, and then adds a full ten percent on the poor tithe years.
3. 30% - This assumes that the poor tithe was a full yearly tithe which would accumulate over the three years.

### Offerings

It is commonly spoken in Evangelical circles that the Scriptures commanded tithes and that offerings were anything above and beyond the tithe. This is reductive.

While many offerings were voluntary and tended to be associated with thankfulness or devotion to God, they were nonetheless instructed in the sense that amount, quality, and type were strictly defined. Furthermore, all of these offerings were associated with the Levitical cult, which means that while they were voluntary, they were associated with the rituals defined by YHWH for the Tabernacle, altars, and eventually Temple.

Crucially, the offerings were shared among the Levites. The proper rites were performed, and then the Levites were given allotted portion. Once again, the care of the Levites is at play.

Below is a table of the offerings that were made.

## The Biblical Vision of Generosity

[^1]: It is far out of scope here to nuance the word "sin" here. It is enough to say that we are better off thinking in terms of cultic purity than in terms of moral uprightness.
