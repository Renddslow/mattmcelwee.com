The role of money and the Church is relatively uncomplicated. Since the earliest days of the Church, the community cared for the needs of their minister (likely first an elder (a role which evolved into the bishop) and then within a generation the priest) and for the needs of the poor and needy, first within their community and then without.

The Church was born out of the generosity of the Father in his giving his only Son. It is unsurprising that this vision of generosity flowed into the operation of the Church as early as 10 days following the ascension of Jesus (cf Acts 2:42-47).

What _is_ complicated is the role of tithing in the Church. This sourcebook will therefore be divided into two sections. The first will address the question of tithing both in its biblical and its historical context. The second will address the biblical vision of generosity in general. The witness of Scripture is sufficient â€“ in my opinion, to cover the latter case on its own and the voices of scholars and Church fathers from the first section ought to aid in offering context to the second. I will however include a BibleProject video.
